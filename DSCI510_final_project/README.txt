This is a descrption file on my final project of DSCI510. 

data folder: This is used to stored all the csv data I used in the project

data_scraping_and_analysis.ipynb: This is the jupyter notebook which contains all the code from scrapping the data online to performing the whole analysis. It also contains explanation on each step. In my case, jupyter notebook would be a more clear and direct way to understand my analysis due to thereâ€™s many visualizations. And I have to constrain my analysis in the py file to make it more readable (But it contains all the significant steps that lead to my result).
